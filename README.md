Election Result Analysis in Python

## Overview and Purpose
In this Module we set out to analyze the election results saved in a .csv file containing all of the votes cast in 3 counties in Colorado(Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe). The file hold a unique ballot ID(voter) what county they are from, and who they voted for. Our mission was to develop a program that runs through the large .csv file and takes the count of each ballot and count them up in respect to county and candidate. In our analysis we will break down the quantity of votes down to the county level for each candidate and the percentage of the total votes in the respective county for each running candidate. The data collected will then presented in an easy to read text file presenting our findings for simple declaration of the winner and their margin of victory.
